### Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
Learned: 
- ```print()``` function, prints whatever is contained into the console, could be any data type or if you enter a variable it will print the value. "Hello World!" 
  - like in C \n creates a newline.
  - concatenation adding strings together _print("Ha" + "ha")_ will print "Haha"
- ```input()``` function, prompts the user for input.
  - _print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
    - will ask "What is your name?"
    - once a user inputs an answer, it will print "Hello Miguel"
  - ```len()``` function, gives us the length of a given string.
    - len("Miguel") will return 6.
- Declaring a variable in python: just name it meaningfully followed by a = and the value.
  - name = "Miguel"
