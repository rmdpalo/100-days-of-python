### Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data
Learned: 
- print() function, prints whatever is contained into the console, could be any data type or if you enter a variable it will print the value. "Hello World!" 
  - like in C \n creates a newline.
  - concatenation adding strings together _print("Ha" + "ha")_ will print "Haha"
- input() function, prompts the user for input.

    - will ask "What is your name?"
