### Day 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

Learned: 
- Print() function, prints whatever is contained into the console, could be any data type or if you enter a variable it will print the value. "Hello World!" 
- like in C \n creates a newline.
- concatenation adding strings together _print("Ha" + "ha")_ will print "Haha"
