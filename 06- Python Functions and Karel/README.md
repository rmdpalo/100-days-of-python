### Day 6 - Python Functions & Karel
Learned:
- [Built in python functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)
- Functions in Python are written such that it is ```python function_name()``` the name followed by a set of parentheses.
- If we want to define our own functions, we have to start it off with the keyword __def__ followed by the function name with parentheses and a colon.
```python
  def my_function():
    #Do this
    #Then this
    #Then finally this
```
- To call a function we just simply type the name of the function with parentheses, and if there are arguments needed, type that in between the parentheses. ```python my_function()```
- Indentation in Python, [Python Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  - PEP 8 style guide dictates that indentations are 4 spaces (tragic, I've been using 2 for the previous repls)
  - While loops in Python
  ```python
    number_of_cookies = 6
    while number_of_cookies > 0:
      eat_cookie()
      number_of_cookies -= 1
  ```
  - Be wary of infinite loops :)
