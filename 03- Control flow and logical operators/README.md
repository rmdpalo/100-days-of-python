### Day 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators
Learned:
- Comparison Operators
  - \>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
- Control Flow
  - if, elif, else
- Logical Operators
  - _and_ means they all have to be true
  - _or_ means only one has to be true
  - _not_ means it should NOT be what the condition is.
- ```.lower()``` turns strings to all lowercase
  ```python 
    "Miguel".lower() #returns "miguel"
  ```
- ```.count()``` gives us the number of times a letter occurs in a string.
  ```python
    "ayaya".count("a") # returns 3
  ```
